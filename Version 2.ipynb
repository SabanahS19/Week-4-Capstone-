Introduction Section :</b>\nDiscussion of the business problem and the audience who would be interested in this project.\nDescription of the Problem and Background\nScenario:\nLet's say I am a data scientist residing in Toronto. A business firm in Manhattan, NY hire me for data analysis to open a restaurent. Both NY and Toronto cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. One interesting idea would be to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. In order to make a comparison and evaluation of the rental options in Manhattan NY, I must set some basis, therefore the property in Manhattan must meet the following demands:\n\ndesired location must be business property\ndesired location is in the Manhattan area, New York\nshould be near to the metro stations\nprice of rent not exceed $7,000 per month\ndesirable to have venues such as coffee shops, restaurants Asian Thai, wine stores, gym and food shops\n\n<b>Business Problem:</b>\nThe challenge is if someone is looking to open a restaurant in Manhattan area, where would you recommend that they open it? Similarly, if a contractor is trying to start their own business, where would you recommend that they setup their office?"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.
